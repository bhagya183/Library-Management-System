Library Management System (Console-Based Application)
<br> <br>
Technologies Used: Java, JDBC, MySQL (or the database used)
Tools: IDE (Eclipse), MySQL Workbench

Project Description:
A console-based Library Management System that allows users to manage books efficiently. 
The system leverages Java's JDBC to interact with a relational database for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on book records.

Features Implemented:

Add Books: Insert new book records into the database, including fields like title, author, genre, and ISBN.
View Books: Display all books in the library with pagination and sorting options.
Search Books: Search for books by title, author, or genre using SQL queries.
Update Books: Modify existing book details stored in the database.
Delete Books: Remove unwanted or outdated book records from the system.


Key Contributions:

Designed and implemented a relational database schema for managing book details.
Utilized JDBC API for database connectivity and executed SQL queries for efficient data management.
Ensured user input validation and error handling to prevent SQL injection and runtime errors.
Applied best practices in Java programming, including modular design and reusable code.


Learning Outcomes:

Strengthened knowledge of JDBC and SQL for database operations.
Gained hands-on experience in designing a console-based management system.
Enhanced problem-solving skills in managing real-time data scenarios.
